This app is built to a browseriy bundle containing jsx snippets and react runtime which compiles everything in the browser.
It can be speeded up by compiling the jsx on the server and returning them with for example Express instead.

To run this, execute following steps (node.js required: found at http://nodejs.org/)

1. npm install
2. grunt
3. node index.js
4. point a browser to index.html port 3000 at server running node
